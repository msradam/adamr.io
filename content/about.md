I'm a software developer at IBM in New York, and love tinkering, data wrangling, poetry, and theater-making. 

Day-to-day, I execute test automation and aid in tech modernization for the IBM Z mainframe platform.

In the recent past, I've stage-managed [Really Really Gorgeous](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/03/theater/really-really-gorgeous-review.html) at [The Tank NYC](https://https://thetanknyc.org/) and worked with [Buildly](https://buildly.io/), an open-source cloud migration and build platform.

I graduated from Wesleyan in May '19 with a double major in Computer Science and Theater. At Wesleyan, I was a [Patricelli Center Fellow](https://www.wesleyan.edu/patricelli/) and the Lights and Rigging Liaison of the '92 Theater for the Second Stage Theater Company, as well as a board member of the Shades Theater Collective for students of color.

I have produced 34 shows at Wesleyan from Fall '18 to Spring '19, and have also been a [sound](http://wesleyanargus.com/2018/11/12/edith-contrasts-childhood-innocence-and-angst-to-dramatic-effect/), [set](https://www.2ndstage.org/la-violecion-of-my-papiyon), and [graphic designer](https://www.facebook.com/rhinowes/). I have [acted](http://wesleyanargus.com/2018/05/07/life-is-a-dream-explores-freedom-fate-and-family/) in, [directed](https://www.2ndstage.org/disgraced), and [stage managed](https://www.wesleyan.edu/cfa/events/2019/03-2019/03062019-action.html) shows as well.

Let's keep in touch!
