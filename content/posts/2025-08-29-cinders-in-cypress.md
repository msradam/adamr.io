In world ending tides with the forests burned down and the empire cities  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beneath us  
We witness that titan still tethered in tempest, his limbs twined and  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tied to the mountainous.

Some clamor that he was to blame for ignition, the spark and the storm  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of our genius  
Others do whisper of him having held us from clay, *pramathyu*,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prometheus.

We shooed off the eagles who dined on his liver and shot his chains open  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with bullets  
Collapsing to cinders, the fiery titan at last found his respite in  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;twilit.

The last of the deities was forced to bear witness to Dayfather's cruel  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;retribution  
To see how the first flame he gave to the mortals enkindled their slow  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;execution.

It's we who remain at the end of our era, our islands succumbed to the  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fire  
With behemoth arrows we aimed at each other, and let loose once down to  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wire.

Our old fertile crescents once lush with the verdant, deserted by acid  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and aching  
The salt and the succor of everyday life, now leveled by human unmaking.

This was the status we spoke to the old thief, who sat 'fore us,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mellowed and speechless  
His torso still healing from torture eternal, we questioned if he would  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beseech us.

Silent we sat in our worm ridden shelter, we breathe in the dust of our  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discord  
I always did daydream of nourishing sleep under roofs undisturbéd and  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;untorched.

The grandson of Heaven and Earth made a gesture to sinew and scars which  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he harbored  
He spoke in a soft voice, and said, 'I endured this, to see your world  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vibrant and arbored.

Defying the Thunder was no easy task, and the pain and the pecking did  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;press me  
Yet through my own screams I did smirk and still listen to mortals dance  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frenzy and freeing

'I knew that the fire I gifted would graze you, and leave you with burns  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and abrasions.  
You quarrel and quip like Olympians used to, with ever increasing  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pervasion.

In spite of the warring, this flame which I gave you, in peacetime you  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;huddled around  
To warm and to weather, the few and the feather, keeping you safer and  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sound.

So long as you love you, the Earth will not end, the tenor of mankind  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continues  
Your flame yet still burning, the Sky still yet turning, with dawning  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and dusking of new hues.

In spite of Fates faded, I give you a prophecy, one buoyant in timing  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most dire,  
Clutch Hope to your heartstrings, and strive to be Heroes, these twin  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;songs newborn of the fire.

So Mortals, who freed me, with faith in me still, this son of Iapet and  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klymenē,  
I bid you farewell and leave you to rebuild, with one final ember of  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evening.'

This old Titan stood up, and burst to inferno, and left behind sparks of  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cool flame,  
And from his cold ashes, rose up two warm flowers, Heroic and Hopeful,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in name.
