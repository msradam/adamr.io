*Secondhand is a short story written by me originally published in the Stuyvesant Spectator, edited and republished here for preservation's sake*

I peek at my watch.

`7:31 p.m.`

I reach into my pocket and pluck a teeny orb amidst the lint. Not unlike that maroon marble I cherished in second grade, coated in swirls and tiny glass bubbles. But no imperfections in what I held, solid as armor, as if I were gazing into my own dark pupil, no reflection.

`7:32 p.m.`

Not too long now, I think, as I cascade the jewel between my fingertips. People and pets whizzed by, a lump in my throat, as I dreamed of freezing them in the gap between seconds. Their whole bodies paused and phased out of eternity.

Another rub of the orb, and they'll be on their way home, slouched on their couches, sipping tea mixed with worries, no extra thought given to that strange man on the park bench, chained to this whimpering guilt at momentarily ending the life of everyone on this planet.

I inhale sharp and rub the little sphere, and virgin silence hammers into my ears, all living things disappeared. 

I get up off the park bench and take a step, it thunders. I wince, and shut my ears to shield myself. A mistake, the mere clap of my hands against my temples felt as if two boxers landed their finest jabs. Still not used to the awakened senses in this liminal space. Even my own thoughts - *silly me* - are too damn. Loud. 

`7:32 p.m.`

I'm not alone in this still world. Here and there is is an audible *tick*. 

I thought it was the orb at first, but holding it to my ear shared no music. I'm not sure what could be ticking out there when everything but me is frozen. Perhaps it is the very heartbeat of this world, finally unburdened by the weight of itself, it breathes.

It reminds me of when I attempt to fall asleep in dusk and all I hear is the perpetual ticking of my two wall clocks, out of sync, reminding me of time passing and of wasted thoughts.

In my world, my halted world that I was gifted, the clocks no longer tick, no clock will ever tick again until I give the word.

This fact consoles me a little, and I cross the street, compulsively matching a footprint with a heartbeat. My own organs churn their symphonies that I slowly tuned out, the soft hum of my own impulses remained for my enjoyment.

Sometimes - or perhaps, no times at all - I think about what would happen if I tossed the orb onto the ground, and stomped it to smithereens. That precious present that was given to me, the ability to pause the flow of seconds, I would bind to permanence. Space would exist without time, an entire fourth dimension stripped of its mobility. The beautiful world stands in absolute stillness, with only I as its witness. All past crises fall to deafness, and future conundrums die on the grapevine. For ever will be for ever, for there will not be a 'will be' anymore, only what is.

*Yeah, it's tempting*, the thought sirens in my skull. 

I rub the orb again, and the gap is closed. I immediately feel the hot breath and warmth of nearby citizens, and I keep on walking. 

`7:33 p.m.`
