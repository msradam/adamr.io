Hi! I'm Adam. I'm a software engineer and recent graduate of Wesleyan University, with a double major in Computer Science and Theater.

At Wesleyan, I was a [Patricelli Center Fellow](https://www.wesleyan.edu/patricelli/) and the head lights technician of the '92 Theater for the [Second Stage Theater Company](https://www.2ndstage.org), as well as a board member of the Shades Theater Collective.

I have produced 34 shows at Wesleyan from Fall '18 to Spring '19, and have also been a [sound](http://wesleyanargus.com/2018/11/12/edith-contrasts-childhood-innocence-and-angst-to-dramatic-effect/), [set](https://www.2ndstage.org/la-violecion-of-my-papiyon), and [graphic designer](https://www.facebook.com/rhinowes/). I have [acted](http://wesleyanargus.com/2018/05/07/life-is-a-dream-explores-freedom-fate-and-family/) in and [directed](https://www.2ndstage.org/disgraced), and [stage managed](https://www.wesleyan.edu/cfa/events/2019/03-2019/03062019-action.html) shows as well.

I also engaged in and promoted the use of fun and cutting-edge technology and art as a founding member of the Immersive Media Group, which culminated in my participation as a VR developer for the ['Immersive Imaginary'](http://wesleyanargus.com/2019/04/23/immersive-imaginary-exhibit-brings-augmented-reality-to-mac650/) exhibit in my final semester.
